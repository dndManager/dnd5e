This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the Sphere, Spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even Magic Items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the Sphere moves with you, centered on you.Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the Sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its Duration.Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as Magic Missile and Charm Person, that target a creature or an object in the Sphere have no effect on that target.Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as Fireball, can't extend into the Sphere. If the Sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the Sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a Wall of Fire are suppressed within the Sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the Sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.Magic Items: The properties and powers of Magic Items are suppressed in the Sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the Sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the Sphere or wielded by an attacker in the Sphere. If a Magic Weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the Sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.Magical Travel: Teleportation and Planar Travel fail to work in the Sphere, whether the Sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the Rope Trick Spells, temporarily closes while in the Sphere.Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the Sphere.

If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer Frightened, but the creature becomes Frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.Sympathy: The Enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its Movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's Physical Characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

""Seen Casually"" is some place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. ""Viewed Once"" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. ""Description"" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.""False Description"" is a place that doesn't exist.

Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be travelled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as north-east, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.Similar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.Mishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly Components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice.• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the Greater Restoration spell.• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to a damage type you choose.• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain Attack.• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance, the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you Cast a Spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.
